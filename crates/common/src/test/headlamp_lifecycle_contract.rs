//! RED → GREEN contract: HeadlampState::Ready, BecomeOn/BecomeOff messages, AssemblyId.
//!
//! Verified behaviours:
//! - `BecomeOn` : Off → Ready (assembly activation)
//! - `BecomeOff`: Ready → Off (assembly deactivation from idle)
//! - `BecomeOff`: On → Off (forced deactivation from lit state)
//! - `Off` ignores lux (assembly not started)
//! - `Ready` triggers `OnRequested` on low lux (assembly active, lamp dark)
//! - `AckOff` lands in `Ready`, not `Off` (lamp off but assembly still active)
//! - `ActuationIncomplete(On)` recovers to `Ready`, not `Off`
//! - `AssemblyId::Headlamp` is constructible (vocabulary smoke)
