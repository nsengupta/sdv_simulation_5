//! Consistency rules between reported FSM state and [`VehicleContext`].
//!
//! Defined only in terms of [`FsmState`] and [`VehicleContext`] — no dependency on [`super::DigitalTwinCar`].
//!
//! The individual laws are pure predicates on `(&FsmState, &VehicleContext)`, gathered into
//! [`STATE_LAWS`], a named catalog, and exposed through the pure public entry point
//! [`verify_state_laws`]. These are the **building blocks**: an external/offline verifier (or
//! a test) reconstructs each **cut** `(FsmState, VehicleContext)` from a captured
//! `PublishedTransitionRecord` stream and folds `verify_state_laws` over it. The library
//! deliberately does **not** ship a journey-fold helper — that consumer-side concern lives
//! outside the twin. The pure laws are an *oracle* (tests / CI / offline / async-sampled),
//! never a PROD hot-path gate; invariants are *enforced* in the FSM transition (clamp/reject)
//! and *announced* via diagnostics.
